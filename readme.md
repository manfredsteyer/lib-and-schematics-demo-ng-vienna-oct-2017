# Demo for Angular Libraries and Schemantics

- ``library``: Demo-Library
- ``schematics``: Schematic for adding a custom service
- ``application``: Demo-Application
  - see gen.bat for howto use the schematic

## Getting ready

Call ``init.bat``. It copies the library and the schematic into the ``node_modules`` folder of the application. Normally, it would be downloaded from an npm registry but for the sake of simplicity we skip this here.

## bat vs. bash vs. whatever

This has been tested on a windows machine -- therefore there are .bat files. It should be quite easy to migrate them to other environments.
